        Spin Time: 21.019s
         | A significant portion of CPU time is spent waiting. Use this metric
         | to discover which synchronizations are spinning. Consider adjusting
         | spin wait parameters, changing the lock implementation (for example,
         | by backing off then descheduling), or adjusting the synchronization
         | granularity.

            MPI Busy Wait Time: 21.019s
             | CPU time spent on waits for MPI communication operations is
             | significant and can negatively impact the application performance
             | and scalability. This can be caused by load imbalance between
             | ranks, active communications or non-optimal settings of MPI
             | library. Explore details on communication inefficiencies with
             | Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector.

Effective Physical Core Utilization: 5.0% (1.786 out of 36)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by:
 |     - load imbalance
 |     - threading runtime overhead
 |     - contended synchronization
 |     - thread/process underutilization
 |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
 |       cores
 | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism
 | or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for
 | other parallel runtimes.
 |
    Effective Logical Core Utilization: 2.5% (1.791 out of 72)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
     | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first
     | step and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in
     | some cases can improve processor throughput and overall performance of
     | multi-threaded applications.
